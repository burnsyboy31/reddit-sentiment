Usually when equities drop ($spy/$qqq/$dia), yields decrease ($us10y) and the strength of the dollar goes up ($dxy) That's what has been 'normal market mechanics' in recent years.

Money doesn't really leave the market, it just moves. In the past that was money leaving the equity market and buying bonds. 

In recent days, why they freaked out, is that money left the equity market (stocks), the bond market (yields going up as people sell US debt) and the dollar (losing strength as people buy the euro)

Which means that money wasn't moving within the US markets, it was leaving it.

That frightens the government because it means we were getting poorer, not just moving around internally.

Hope this helps you make sense of why they would be walking things back this weekend",ve see thread reddit ask matter yield act time context go to copy paste write maybe ll sense not understand new usually equity drop spyqqqdia yield decrease usy strength dollar go dxy s normal market mechanic recent year money not leave market move past money leave equity market buy bond recent day freak money leave equity market stock bond market yield go people sell debt dollar lose strength people buy euro mean money not move market leave frighten government mean get poorer move internally hope help sense walk thing weekend,29,2025-04-12 21:30:07
