* come up with a fairly good initial plan balancing my heavy investment into puts with calls to recover my initial buy in that should have made money
* holding onto options that have gained significant value for too long, fuck 4-6x returns this is going to be the mega dump and I want in! Only to watch things quickly flip and the gains fade away
* not buying multiple contracts so I can cash out most for nice gains but still have a little action in play
* not cutting my losses quickly enough and forgetting how quickly the theta gang is coming for my unlubed asshole
* panic selling options that still had lots of time to gain value from a volatile market
* forgetting day trading limits and getting stuck in dumb positions because I’m a poor degenerate that doesn’t have 25k to swing around

Usually when equities drop ($spy/$qqq/$dia), yields decrease ($us10y) and the strength of the dollar goes up ($dxy) That's what has been 'normal market mechanics' in recent years.

Money doesn't really leave the market, it just moves. In the past that was money leaving the equity market and buying bonds. 

In recent days, why they freaked out, is that money left the equity market (stocks), the bond market (yields going up as people sell US debt) and the dollar (losing strength as people buy the euro)

Which means that money wasn't moving within the US markets, it was leaving it.

That frightens the government because it means we were getting poorer, not just moving around internally.

Under this new agreement, they’re going to be buying a record amount of American squid. I mean so much squid, folks, your heads will spin. They’ll be eating beautiful, premium, American squid caught in our great American waters, by our great American fishermen, many of whom,by the way, voted for me. Smart people. Hardworking people.

The fake news said it couldn’t be done. “Mr. President,” they said, “the island is uninhabited.” But I said, “Excuse me — have you met the penguins?” And let me tell you: they were ready to negotiate.

mnkd69y,"Some excerpts from WSJ's article about Elon and his plans to have a legion of children , having at least 14 known children, but probably shitload of more who are staying silent unlike this grifter woman who went public after he cut her off.

> In Musk’s dark view of the world, civilization is under threat because of a declining population. He is driven to correct the historic moment by helping seed the earth with more human beings of high intelligence, according to people familiar with the matter. 

> Musk refers to his offspring as a “legion,” a reference to the ancient military units that could contain thousands of soldiers and were key to extending the reach of the Roman Empire. 

> During St. Clair’s pregnancy, Musk suggested that they bring in other women to have even more of their children faster. “To reach legion-level before the apocalypse,” he said to St. Clair in a text message viewed by The Wall Street Journal, “we will need to use surrogates.” 

> In 2023, he had a meeting in Austin where people he described as Japanese officials asked him to be a sperm donor for a high-profile woman, according to a text message reviewed by the Journal. “They want me to be a sperm donor. No romance or anything, just sperm,” he texted St. Clair. Musk later told her he gave his sperm to the person who asked for it, without naming the woman. 

There is another big part of some other Twitter woman who he started to follow, liked her stuff, subscribed to her with bunch of bots, and made her get huge revenue from Twitter premium in just a week, and then he asked her to have his children, she rejected him, and he cut her off from Twitter premium, unfollowed etc... lmao

Edit: Also, I don't think it will move much upside if the hit their earnings. so I’d not waste on calls even if you are bullish. Also, your puts may not have much of an IV crush. As it is expected to be uncertain next week anyways",13,bearish,2025-04-17 18:29:02

Average gold  price was 2850 ish.   It’s 3300 now and  If it keeps going up these miners will be making more profit than the chip companies.    At 60-70% margins.  And if you tac the 16x forward earnings industy average on NEM with 3 billion in net earnings.   They make 12 billion per year.    So 12x16 =192 b market cap.  Current market cap is 62 billion.

mnu04bn,"Man I wish there was some way of putting money on a bet that Elon will be a John McAffe-style fugitive by 2028. TSLA's very likely going to blow eventually up in every major auto scandal rolled together.

As per that Canadian weekend sales pump to dupe emissions credits, he's probably cooking Tesler's books Ghosn-style. As per that Robotaxi event where the cars were remote-controlled and the robots were people, he's false presenting like that Nikola guy did. If this odometer tampering class action lawsuit from yesterday plays out, Tesler will be up against the wrath shady used car dealers have been getting on a small scale for years. If these FSD lawsuits play out - and Autopilot shutting itself off right before collisions so they can tell the NHTSA it wasn't involved - Tesler's liable for multiple deaths.

Elon's a *master* bullshitter, to the point where he's been able to bullshit his way into being the richest dude on earth. I think him talking about how fucked he was if the election didn't play out is very true; he knew all of this shit was coming to a head, and getting Mango in his pocket (and the DoT head replaced by a guy from *The Real World*) was likely the only way to keep this house of cards together. But as soon as the tides turn again, he's fucked; half of the acronym agencies in America are going to be knee-deep up in his ass, and he knows it. Even if he buys himself a personal pardon, Tesler will be sued into the grave, and the magic of his pied-piper bullshit Iron Man act will be gone.

So I think he's going to cash out some chips and go on the run within the decade. Ditch his 48 kids, grow an ugly neckbeard and dodge lawsuit liability by bouncing between rich-guy safe havens and the special economic zones set up by his tech bro friends.

That means, the government will manufacture some national problem (mortgage crisis, covid, ww3, etc) that requires the passing of a $4T to $6T spending bill that will magically have bi-partisan support.

As the USD loses strength as a reserve currency, these manufactured events will become more frequent.

Point being, inflation is inevitable, and it's in the government's favor to under report it.  Moreover, the Federal Reserve is a private bank with private interests, as well as anonymous owners.  The fed is more than content with enabling the US to default on our national debt, so that the global vulture that is the IMF can bail us out in exchange for adopting favorable legislation, that would further allow them to suck all the assets out of this country.

Just look at what happened to Greece when they defaulted in 2008. Government pensions disappeared, $100 withdrawal limits placed on all banks, national assets seizures, forced to pass laws to increase taxes on the people, etc, etc...   It is no coincidence that the IMF, has the third largest gold reserves--when it is not even a country. 

In conclusion, expect some dumbass crisis that tanks the markets, and brings us to the brink of default, only to be saved by the passage of some crazy spending bill, which then causes another inflation-fueled bull run that will melt your face off. 

That is all...  You heard it here first.",9,bearish,2025-04-18 21:02:44
mntebwn,"ChatGPT blew a gasket. ""Looking ahead to Monday, April 21, 2025, technical analysis suggests that SPY may open around $590.44, with potential intraday fluctuations between $586.84 and $601.52. This range indicates a possible movement of approximately ±1.23% from the previous close. The ETF is currently closer to its support level at $590.83, which could present a favorable risk/reward scenario for traders .​[StockInvest](https://stockinvest.us/stock/SPY?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

However, market sentiment remains cautious due to ongoing concerns about trade policies and economic growth. Analysts have expressed mixed views, with some forecasting potential gains for the S&P 500 by mid-2025, while others anticipate challenges ahead .​[Business Insider+1Business Insider+1](https://www.businessinsider.com/stock-market-outlook-prediction-tariff-trade-war-economy-earnings-keller-2025-4?utm_source=chatgpt.com)[Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/markets/us/evercore-isi-sees-sp-500-6600-by-mid-2025-2024-11-06/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

In Q1 2025, those BTC lost 140 mil in value. They had  336k deliveries. If they got the same 3.4k per delivery, that's 1,140 mil, minus the BTC loss is 1 billion.

Puts are imo too risky, so long as they don’t say anything dumb the stock goes up. General Motors has earnings on 4/29 BMO, considering grabbing puts as the guidance will be heavily dependent on raw materials & 🥭. Shorting Tesla seems like a bad move in general. American Airlines (AAL) looks like a good shorting opportunity, last quarter for them was embarrassing and I don’t see how the company can turn around now. Contrarily, LUV is in a slightly better spot than AAL, but I don’t see the benefit in playing their earnings. Intel is in a unique position as a semiconductor business, but tariffs for raw materials will make it difficult for the company to issue good guidance.

Boeing bounced on being awarded the F-47 but with the critical minerals required now under export restrictions (especially those under single supply..) it seems possible that they will announce a delay on that project timeline, and it seems bad news will be punished badly.

I will time the market every chance I get. I do not care for the boring advice of the bogleheads, or the patient will of the value investors. I will ignore all my losses and hold till the end, and will rejoyce with the most passionate euphoria at the smallest gains.

Why do I do this you ask? surely I can see the irrationality, the pure retardation of my senile decision making? Surely, at some point I will finally give in to the despair of failure?

Never. For my reasoning is far more beautifully complex, yet facinatingly simple for any of you to understand.

I feel smart, so I am smart.

No amount of logic will ever compare to the sheer power of my rationalizations. My eyes are incapable of blinding me to my dreams. My ears will never hear an argument able to drown out the voice of ambition within my own head. For when I feel good, I am good.

The same endorphins that flood my brain when I hold an options victory are the same ones that I feel during my most delusional dreams of grandeur.

The same shades of green that color a blessed portfolio are just as vivid as the one’s I see in my day dreams.

No loss matters. No amount of money could ever make me change my mind. My belief is unbreakable, and it’s dividends of joy are always received.

So, if I believe I will become a billionaire, I might as well already be one.

If I believe I am the next Warren Buffet, than I already am.

An NLRB whistleblower report has presented evidence that DOGE actions at the NLRB were a Russian espionage operation

A whistleblower at the NLRB reports that after DOGE demanded root access to NLRB systems, they disabled network logs and multi-factor authentication. Within 15 minutes of DOGE being given permissions, access was attempted with the new DOGE username/password login information from Russia. Logs of network and CPU useage indicate that approximately 10 gigabytes of text was successfully exfiltrated from NLRB systems to an unknown endpoint.

A U.S. cyber response team was about to be called in, but senior U.S. officials told them to stand down, to cease investigation and generate no report.

While preparing his disclosure, the whistleblower found a drone surveillance photo of himself taped to his front door with a threatening note.

For months, Mr. Trump has privately fretted about the prospect of a Great Depression-scale event’s happening on his watch — a scenario he shorthands in conversations as “1929.” But the events of the past two weeks so alarmed some of Mr. Trump’s closest advisers, including his Treasury secretary, Scott Bessent, that Mr. Trump himself seems to have absorbed how close they came to a financial meltdown.

mnzrn6e,"This is not just another penny biotech. Vaxart is a disruptor. While the giants pushed traditional vaccine delivery methods, Vaxart quietly developed a revolutionary oral tablet vaccine platform — needle-free, shelf-stable, easy to distribute globally. This tech has the potential to reshape how vaccines are delivered across the world.

Yes, VXRT took a beating during the biotech downturn. But what many traders miss is that Vaxart survived. They kept innovating while others folded. Their Norovirus program is advancing. Their COVID and flu platforms are still in play. The IP is strong, the vision is intact, and the cash burn is under control compared to other biotechs.

We’re looking at a company that was once a $10+ stock with insane volume, now trading under a buck — but the fundamentals are better now than they were during the hype. The risk/reward down here is ridiculous.

What happens when one catalyst hits? Or when biotech sentiment turns? Or when someone bigger sees the value of an oral vaccine platform and wants in?

This is accumulation territory. Quiet now, but it won’t stay that way for long.

mo2tav0,"I am completely controlled by emotion.

I buy at every pump, and sell at every dump. I am incapable of resisting the horrific screams of my anxiety, or the frantic frenzy of my greed. I am a mere lowly animal.

I will time the market every chance I get. I do not care for the boring advice of the bogleheads, or the patient will of the value investors. I will ignore all my losses and hold till the end, and will rejoyce with the most passionate euphoria at the smallest gains.

Why do I do this you ask? surely I can see the irrationality, the pure retardation of my senile decision making? Surely, at some point I will finally give in to the despair of failure?

Never. For my reasoning is far more beautifully complex, yet fascinatingly simple for any of you to understand.

**I feel smart, so I** ***am*** **smart.**

No amount of logic will ever compare to the sheer power of my rationalizations. My eyes are incapable of blinding me to my dreams. My ears will never hear an argument able to drown out the voice of ambition within my own head. For when I feel good, I am good.

The same endorphins that flood my brain when I hold an options victory are the same ones that I feel during my most delusional dreams of grandeur.

The same shades of green that color a blessed portfolio are just as vivid as the one’s I see in my day dreams.

No loss matters. No amount of money could ever make me change my mind. My belief is unbreakable, and it’s dividends of joy are always received.

So, if I believe I will become a billionaire, I might as well already be one.

If I believe I am the next Warren Buffet, then I already am.

My heart still flutters, my ego grows. The further I float above reality, the more impossible it becomes to drag that euphoria back to the ground.

TSLA just posted its best quarterly results ever, with incredibly fantastic numbers that everyone can totally trust—numbers so good, even Elon can't keep a straight face! (Hint: It’s not just the ketamine.)

Tesla stock surged a mind-boggling 42,069% after Elon Musk revealed Optimus Robots are officially smarter than humans, can s\*ck you off behind Wendy’s, and lose more money on options than you! 🤖✨

But wait—there’s more! Tesla's Full Self-Driving now not only runs errands, but it's also autonomously transporting humans to the new Cyber Gulag in El Salvador to assemble even more Optimus bots. Furthermore, Musk announced the Cybertrain, which can deport thousands of TSLA critics at once. Talk about efficiency! 🏝️🚗🤖

In even bigger news, Tesla will acquire XAi, forming a mega-corp of freedom-loving AI that writes right wing poetry and pumps Fartcoin —poised to become the most valuable company in the galaxy. 🚀💰

Lastly, thanks to Musk's legendary success with DOGE, the U.S. government decided to buy up all the leftover Teslas that didn’t sell, turning the nation into one giant Tesla dealership. Sorry, taxpayers—freedom isn't free, but apparently, Teslas now are! 🇺🇸💸

moeru61,"[Argentex Group Plc](https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/AGFX:LN) suspended trading in its shares after the currency management firm faced a “rapid and significant” cash squeeze in the wake of Donald Trump’s tariff announcements.

The London-listed company said in a statement Tuesday it’s taking steps to preserve cash and increase collateral from counterparties after it was hit by margin calls linked to its foreign exchange derivatives book this month.

Argentex said it is in talks with its principal liquidity provider to strengthen its position, while warning that “in the event that the volatility in currency markets worsens materially then the company’s financial liquidity position, if not strengthened in the near term, would be significantly stretched.”

The firm offers clients such as financial institutions and corporations access to multiple currencies and strategies to hedge against swings in foreign exchange, according to its website.

The [devaluation of the US dollar](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-04-22/bearish-dollar-bets-move-toward-levels-that-raise-risk-of-recoil) is at the core of Argentex’s trouble, with the Bloomberg dollar spot index declining 4.5% since tariffs were announced at the start of the month.

Argentex was founded in 2012 and first sold shares to the public seven years later via London’s Alternative Investment Market. The firm’s biggest shareholder is Pacific Investments, the finance firm backed by UK businessman John Beckwith. Customers of Argentex range from Aviva Plc, the London-based insurer, to Triumph Motorcyles, a global motorbike firm based in Derbyshire, its website shows.

The firm reported an operating loss of about £200,000 ($267,370) on revenue of £50.3 million for 2024, according to its accounts published April 2.",4,neutral,2025-04-22 10:54:01

Then, at 5:18 PM ET, President Trump said tariffs on China ""will not be as high as 145%.""

Bessent effectively told a closed-group of Wall Street investors that de-escalation with China was coming BEFORE the public knew.

The result was a move of +5% in S&P 500 futures, for a total of +$2.2 TRILLION of market cap.

Investors at the JP Morgan event were able to front-run these headlines.

Donald Trump is planning to spare carmakers from some of his most onerous tariffs following intense lobbying by industry executives over recent weeks, according to a report in the Financial Times.

Sources told the paper that the US president could exempt tariffs on car parts coming from China while also levying duties on imported steel and aluminum.

The exemptions, however, would leave in place the 25% tariff Trump imposed on all imports of foreign-made cars.

The 25% duty on foreign-imported car parts, which is due to take effect on 3 May, is also expected to continue, according to the FT.

1. Digital-ad slowdown is real: Mounting competitive pressure on Search & YouTube from ChatGPT, TikTok and Amazon, with analysts bracing for Google’s slowest revenue growth in four quarters.
2. Cloud can’t bail them out. Google Cloud missed estimates last quarter, and its growth has cooled to the high-20 % range—well below the mid-30 % it posted a year ago.
3. Consensus leaves little room for error. The Street is at $89.2 B revenue / $2.01 EPS; any topline wobble plus heavy spending is a recipe for disappointment.

China's foreign ministry urged Washington on Friday to stop ""misleading the public"" on bilateral tariff negotiations, and said it wasn't familiar with reports on whether Beijing was planning to exempt tariffs on some U.S. imports.

""The United States and China are not engaged in consultations or talks on the tariff issue,"" Guo Jiakun, a spokesperson for the ministry, said at a press briefing.

3. And for the above reason Tesla earnings are not real either.

Each wick was bold, quick to stun,

His eyes burned red, and his horns did maul,

“It’s possible we’ll do a complete tax cut because I think tariffs will be enough to cut all the income tax”

Tariffs aren’t going anywhere. This week is gonna suck.

And for all you idiots saying Zero Income Tax is great……do the fucking math

Tariffs generate $80 billion in revenue. Income taxes generate $2.2 trillion in revenue. Tariffs would have to increase by 2800% to replace income taxes. None if this is realistic and worse,  it’s dangerous.

Key highlights:

* GAAP earnings per share projected at $0.16 to $0.17, below prior guidance of $0.36 to $0.53
* Non-GAAP earnings per share estimated at $0.29 to $0.31, lower than previous $0.46 to $0.62
* Gross margin declined 220 basis points from Q2 due to higher inventory reserves and expedite costs
* Some customer platform decisions were delayed, shifting sales to Q4
* New generation product design wins remain strong",11,neutral,2025-04-29 20:38:22

mpthfn1,"**Curtis Mathis Resurrects American Manufacturing with New Line of U.S.-Made TVs**  
*April 30, 2025 — Austin, TX*

In a surprising twist that has industry analysts buzzing, legacy electronics brand **Curtis Mathis**announced it is returning to prominence with a new line of televisions—**proudly manufactured in the United States**. The company, once known in the 1960s for its ""better than the best"" slogan, is building a state-of-the-art factory in Texas that will churn out 4K and 8K smart TVs using primarily domestic components.

CEO Thomas Reed, grandson of the company’s founder, said, *“Americans want quality they can believe in—and they’re tired of plastic junk from overseas. We’re bringing back pride in the product and jobs to the people.”*

Though skeptics question whether the company can compete on price, early leaks show sleek designs, robust firmware, and a promise of *zero data harvesting*. Preorders start in June, and according to insiders, Curtis Mathis may even be eyeing partnerships with retro-tech influencers and American-made content platforms.

Will it be a real comeback or just a patriotic flash in the pan? Time—and the market—will tell.",3,bullish,2025-04-30 10:53:41

That’s crazy.

Let’s be clear — these tariffs are active right now. Nothing was rolled back. And on top of that, China and the EU have already retaliated, so we’re not waiting for escalation — it’s already here.

This feels like a classic dead cat bounce. The market’s reacting to headlines without thinking through the actual economic impact.

Palantir,  hims and hers, Realty Income.  
AMD, Rivian, Lucid  
Disney, Oxy, Dutch Bros  
Conoco , Affirm

Quick explanation   
$O - collects rent from commercial properties, with businesses at risk if they report less income that means less consumer spending and less business overall.  Also a super popular dividend stock.  
$AMD, Rivian, Lucid - remember which sub you are in  
Disney - consumer spending  
Oxy - oil and gas - production and consumption  
Dutch Bros - consumer spending on coffee  
Conoco - oil production and consumption  
Affirm - Americans are poor so they are putting everything on payment plans.  A huge increase here is a signal that no one can afford anything.

My only reservation is Q2 guidance. My belief is that the early release of the MI350 chips due to customer demand possibly slowed sales of the MI325 chips with customers willing to wait for the MI350. That was why it appeared according to WS that amd AI chips didn’t gain enough traction in 1H 2025 and led them to question overall adoption of amd AI chips. What puzzled me is that if I had this theory, why didn’t any analyst at least ask Lisa about it on the last ER? Did they not think of this or did they and it just gave them an excuse to pound on amd to lower the pps? That could result in a lower than expected guide for Q2 but a big up guide for Q3. Amd must have stolen more business from intel in Q1 and probably going forward in Q2 as well. It looks like WS is already expecting a sequential rev decline for Q2 from what I can see so I don’t know what they may have cooked up.

1. Sell the News partnership 

Novo partnership was a sell the news event. The partnership happened after quarter close, so none of the “benefits” if there are any will be included, at most there will be guidance which is a bit useless since hims’ business model is based on subscription and affordability. Prior to the partnership, hims was making money off of the semaglitude shortage, and were selling pills at 199, virtually undercutting novo and Lilly. This partnership just protects them from legal scrutiny. 

2. Business Model

Hims business model is based on affordability. Prior to partnership, the semaglitude subscription was 199 per month. Now it’s going to be 599-699, do any of you really think consumer spending is that strong that people are WILLINGLY spending half a grand on medication that isn’t even covered by health insurance?

3. Twitter/X activity

Every retarded finance guru on Twitter is bullish on hims.  This means the top is in.

This move is in response to escalating U.S. tariffs under President Trump, particularly on **steel, aluminum, cars, and potentially sectors like semiconductors, pharmaceuticals, and critical minerals**.

Key points:

* The EU will share the proposed tariff list with member states soon, with a final decision after a 1-month consultation.
* The EU is also proposing to the U.S. a trade package that includes **reducing trade barriers and boosting investment**.
* So far, talks have made **little progress**, and the U.S. tariffs may remain largely intact.
* This new action would be on top of **€21 billion** in existing EU tariffs.
* The EU had a **€48 billion trade surplus** with the U.S. in 2023.
* All options are being considered, including targeting U.S. services and export restrictions.

We don’t need their Cars, we don’t need their Energy, we don’t need their Lumber, we don’t need ANYTHING they have, other than their friendship, which hopefully we will always maintain. They, on the other hand, need EVERYTHING from us! The Prime Minister will be arriving shortly and that will be, most likely, my only question of consequence.

mqwhlrm,"""Port officials said traffic is down nearly half at the two Southern California ports, signaling that there are fewer products now in LA from China and that there will be fewer jobs.

“We are at a point of inflection. It’s kind of dire,” Mario Cordero, port of Long Beach CEO said Monday. “What happens here is going to be an indication of what's going to occur in the supply chain. We have less vessel calls, less cargo now.”

The port of Long Beach is already reporting a huge drop in traffic this week with 34 canceled sailings from ocean carriers to Long Beach. The neighboring port of Los Angeles is also seeing 36 cancellations.

Things have not been this slow since the coronavirus pandemic, Cordero said.

“Covid gave us an insight of what happens when the cargo stops. We certainly don’t want to repeat that scenario again,” he added.

The two ports, which moved 20 million containers last year, are showing a 44% drop in docked vessels in the week of May 4 compared to last year.""

mqzdihz,"Treasury Secretary Bessent says not to expect US-China trade deal to come out of upcoming trade talks

US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said Tuesday not to expect a big trade deal when he and US Trade Representative Jamieson Greer are expected to meet with Chinese officials later this week.

“My sense is that this will be about de escalation, not about the big trade deal … but we’ve got to de escalate before we can move forward,” Bessent told Fox News.

Bessent’s comments come as the US and China — the world’s two largest economies — have slapped escalating tariffs on each other as part of a larger global trade war sparked by US President Donald Trmp. 

Bessent said Trmp was using “strategic uncertainty” to “get the best trade deals possible.”

The news of an upcoming conversation between the two superpowers could mark a thawing in what has so far been a chilly trade relationship during Trmp’s second term. Bessent stressed on Tuesday that the US doesn’t want to “decouple” with China.

“The world has been coming to the US (for deals), and China has been the missing piece,” he said. “We don’t want to decouple; what we want is fair trade.”

mqzr05d,"Federal Reserve Press Conference – May 7, 2025
Statement by Chair Jerome H. Powell

Good afternoon. At today’s meeting, the Federal Open Market Committee decided to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 5.25 to 5.50 percent.

This decision reflects the Committee’s ongoing commitment to our dual mandate: promoting maximum employment and achieving inflation at the rate of 2 percent over the longer run.

Over the past several months, we have observed considerable progress in restoring balance to the economy. Labor markets remain strong, with unemployment near historic lows and job creation continuing at a healthy pace. Consumer demand has shown resilience, and the U.S. economy continues to expand at a moderate rate.

However, inflation remains elevated. While we have seen some encouraging signs of moderation, the most recent readings indicate that inflationary pressures are still too persistent to warrant a change in our current policy stance. The Committee continues to believe that it will take more time to gain confidence that inflation is moving sustainably toward our 2 percent target.

Let me be clear: our decision today does not rule out rate cuts in the future. We are closely monitoring incoming data and are prepared to adjust our policy stance as appropriate. But at this time, given the strength of the labor market and the limited progress on inflation, we believe it is appropriate to keep the policy rate unchanged.

We understand the impact our decisions have on households, businesses, and communities. We remain steadfast in our commitment to restore price stability, because we know that the path to sustained economic growth and broad-based prosperity requires an environment of stable prices.

As always, we will base our decisions on the totality of the data, the evolving outlook, and the balance of risks.

Thank you. I’ll now take your questions.",11,neutral,2025-05-07 01:39:47
