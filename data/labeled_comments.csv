But importers say that a glitch in the system has meant that they have not started paying tariffs yet, despite Turnip saying that the tariffs, particularly the 145% tariffs on China, are already in place.

According to CNBC, the glitch comes from CBP currently not being able to tell which ships are exempted from the tariffs, because they were “on the water” before the tariffs went into effect, and those that were shipped out after the tariffs.""

* come up with a fairly good initial plan balancing my heavy investment into puts with calls to recover my initial buy in that should have made money
* holding onto options that have gained significant value for too long, fuck 4-6x returns this is going to be the mega dump and I want in! Only to watch things quickly flip and the gains fade away
* not buying multiple contracts so I can cash out most for nice gains but still have a little action in play
* not cutting my losses quickly enough and forgetting how quickly the theta gang is coming for my unlubed asshole
* panic selling options that still had lots of time to gain value from a volatile market
* forgetting day trading limits and getting stuck in dumb positions because I’m a poor degenerate that doesn’t have 25k to swing around

Every option I had going into this week would have made money if I had just been happy with 4-6x gains and I managed to to loose 87% of my money

Usually when equities drop ($spy/$qqq/$dia), yields decrease ($us10y) and the strength of the dollar goes up ($dxy) That's what has been 'normal market mechanics' in recent years.

Money doesn't really leave the market, it just moves. In the past that was money leaving the equity market and buying bonds. 

In recent days, why they freaked out, is that money left the equity market (stocks), the bond market (yields going up as people sell US debt) and the dollar (losing strength as people buy the euro)

Which means that money wasn't moving within the US markets, it was leaving it.

That frightens the government because it means we were getting poorer, not just moving around internally.

We’ve made a deal, a fantastic deal, with the Heard and McDonald Islands. Great birds. Great tuxedos. Very classy.


Under this new agreement, they’re going to be buying a record amount of American squid. I mean so much squid, folks, your heads will spin. They’ll be eating beautiful, premium, American squid caught in our great American waters, by our great American fishermen, many of whom,by the way, voted for me. Smart people. Hardworking people.

The fake news said it couldn’t be done. “Mr. President,” they said, “the island is uninhabited.” But I said, “Excuse me — have you met the penguins?” And let me tell you: they were ready to negotiate.

> Musk refers to his offspring as a “legion,” a reference to the ancient military units that could contain thousands of soldiers and were key to extending the reach of the Roman Empire. 

> During St. Clair’s pregnancy, Musk suggested that they bring in other women to have even more of their children faster. “To reach legion-level before the apocalypse,” he said to St. Clair in a text message viewed by The Wall Street Journal, “we will need to use surrogates.” 

> In 2023, he had a meeting in Austin where people he described as Japanese officials asked him to be a sperm donor for a high-profile woman, according to a text message reviewed by the Journal. “They want me to be a sperm donor. No romance or anything, just sperm,” he texted St. Clair. Musk later told her he gave his sperm to the person who asked for it, without naming the woman.

Average gold  price was 2850 ish.   It’s 3300 now and  If it keeps going up these miners will be making more profit than the chip companies.    At 60-70% margins.  And if you tac the 16x forward earnings industy average on NEM with 3 billion in net earnings.   They make 12 billion per year.    So 12x16 =192 b market cap.  Current market cap is 62 billion.

mnu04bn,"Man I wish there was some way of putting money on a bet that Elon will be a John McAffe-style fugitive by 2028. TSLA's very likely going to blow eventually up in every major auto scandal rolled together.

As per that Canadian weekend sales pump to dupe emissions credits, he's probably cooking Tesler's books Ghosn-style. As per that Robotaxi event where the cars were remote-controlled and the robots were people, he's false presenting like that Nikola guy did. If this odometer tampering class action lawsuit from yesterday plays out, Tesler will be up against the wrath shady used car dealers have been getting on a small scale for years. If these FSD lawsuits play out - and Autopilot shutting itself off right before collisions so they can tell the NHTSA it wasn't involved - Tesler's liable for multiple deaths.

Elon's a *master* bullshitter, to the point where he's been able to bullshit his way into being the richest dude on earth. I think him talking about how fucked he was if the election didn't play out is very true; he knew all of this shit was coming to a head, and getting Mango in his pocket (and the DoT head replaced by a guy from *The Real World*) was likely the only way to keep this house of cards together. But as soon as the tides turn again, he's fucked; half of the acronym agencies in America are going to be knee-deep up in his ass, and he knows it. Even if he buys himself a personal pardon, Tesler will be sued into the grave, and the magic of his pied-piper bullshit Iron Man act will be gone.

So I think he's going to cash out some chips and go on the run within the decade. Ditch his 48 kids, grow an ugly neckbeard and dodge lawsuit liability by bouncing between rich-guy safe havens and the special economic zones set up by his tech bro friends.

That means, the government will manufacture some national problem (mortgage crisis, covid, ww3, etc) that requires the passing of a $4T to $6T spending bill that will magically have bi-partisan support.

As the USD loses strength as a reserve currency, these manufactured events will become more frequent.

Point being, inflation is inevitable, and it's in the government's favor to under report it.  Moreover, the Federal Reserve is a private bank with private interests, as well as anonymous owners.  The fed is more than content with enabling the US to default on our national debt, so that the global vulture that is the IMF can bail us out in exchange for adopting favorable legislation, that would further allow them to suck all the assets out of this country.

Just look at what happened to Greece when they defaulted in 2008. Government pensions disappeared, $100 withdrawal limits placed on all banks, national assets seizures, forced to pass laws to increase taxes on the people, etc, etc...   It is no coincidence that the IMF, has the third largest gold reserves--when it is not even a country. 

In conclusion, expect some dumbass crisis that tanks the markets, and brings us to the brink of default, only to be saved by the passage of some crazy spending bill, which then causes another inflation-fueled bull run that will melt your face off.

In Q1 2025, those BTC lost 140 mil in value. They had  336k deliveries. If they got the same 3.4k per delivery, that's 1,140 mil, minus the BTC loss is 1 billion.

Puts are imo too risky, so long as they don’t say anything dumb the stock goes up. General Motors has earnings on 4/29 BMO, considering grabbing puts as the guidance will be heavily dependent on raw materials & 🥭. Shorting Tesla seems like a bad move in general. American Airlines (AAL) looks like a good shorting opportunity, last quarter for them was embarrassing and I don’t see how the company can turn around now. Contrarily, LUV is in a slightly better spot than AAL, but I don’t see the benefit in playing their earnings. Intel is in a unique position as a semiconductor business, but tariffs for raw materials will make it difficult for the company to issue good guidance.

It went From 36 an oz to 3360.      Sure look at BTC If you want but what I’m saying is there is a 5000 year history of gold being a store of value.    And during the 70-80 when there was de dollarization gold went up. In 2008 to now it went up.  And now if we are printing money and the world is backing away form he dollar the evidence points to gold going up.  And the miners are lagging behind the gold price.

I buy at every pump, and sell at every dump. I am incapable resisting the horrific screams of my anxiety, or the frantic frenzy of my greed. I am a mere lowly animal.

I will time the market every chance I get. I do not care for the boring advice of the bogleheads, or the patient will of the value investors. I will ignore all my losses and hold till the end, and will rejoyce with the most passionate euphoria at the smallest gains.

Why do I do this you ask? surely I can see the irrationality, the pure retardation of my senile decision making? Surely, at some point I will finally give in to the despair of failure?

Never. For my reasoning is far more beautifully complex, yet facinatingly simple for any of you to understand.

I feel smart, so I am smart.

No amount of logic will ever compare to the sheer power of my rationalizations. My eyes are incapable of blinding me to my dreams. My ears will never hear an argument able to drown out the voice of ambition within my own head. For when I feel good, I am good.

The same endorphins that flood my brain when I hold an options victory are the same ones that I feel during my most delusional dreams of grandeur.

The same shades of green that color a blessed portfolio are just as vivid as the one’s I see in my day dreams.

No loss matters. No amount of money could ever make me change my mind. My belief is unbreakable, and it’s dividends of joy are always received.

So, if I believe I will become a billionaire, I might as well already be one.

If I believe I am the next Warren Buffet, than I already am.

An NLRB whistleblower report has presented evidence that DOGE actions at the NLRB were a Russian espionage operation

A whistleblower at the NLRB reports that after DOGE demanded root access to NLRB systems, they disabled network logs and multi-factor authentication. Within 15 minutes of DOGE being given permissions, access was attempted with the new DOGE username/password login information from Russia. Logs of network and CPU useage indicate that approximately 10 gigabytes of text was successfully exfiltrated from NLRB systems to an unknown endpoint.

A U.S. cyber response team was about to be called in, but senior U.S. officials told them to stand down, to cease investigation and generate no report.

While preparing his disclosure, the whistleblower found a drone surveillance photo of himself taped to his front door with a threatening note.

For months, Mr. Trump has privately fretted about the prospect of a Great Depression-scale event’s happening on his watch — a scenario he shorthands in conversations as “1929.” But the events of the past two weeks so alarmed some of Mr. Trump’s closest advisers, including his Treasury secretary, Scott Bessent, that Mr. Trump himself seems to have absorbed how close they came to a financial meltdown.

While the giants pushed traditional vaccine delivery methods, Vaxart quietly developed a revolutionary oral tablet vaccine platform — needle-free, shelf-stable, easy to distribute globally. This tech has the potential to reshape how vaccines are delivered across the world.

Yes, VXRT took a beating during the biotech downturn. But what many traders miss is that Vaxart survived. They kept innovating while others folded. Their Norovirus program is advancing. Their COVID and flu platforms are still in play. The IP is strong, the vision is intact, and the cash burn is under control compared to other biotechs.

We’re looking at a company that was once a $10+ stock with insane volume, now trading under a buck — but the fundamentals are better now than they were during the hype. The risk/reward down here is ridiculous.

What happens when one catalyst hits? Or when biotech sentiment turns? Or when someone bigger sees the value of an oral vaccine platform and wants in?

mo2tav0,"I am completely controlled by emotion.

I buy at every pump, and sell at every dump. I am incapable of resisting the horrific screams of my anxiety, or the frantic frenzy of my greed. I am a mere lowly animal.

I will time the market every chance I get. I do not care for the boring advice of the bogleheads, or the patient will of the value investors. I will ignore all my losses and hold till the end, and will rejoyce with the most passionate euphoria at the smallest gains.

Why do I do this you ask? surely I can see the irrationality, the pure retardation of my senile decision making? Surely, at some point I will finally give in to the despair of failure?

Never. For my reasoning is far more beautifully complex, yet fascinatingly simple for any of you to understand.

**I feel smart, so I** ***am*** **smart.**

No amount of logic will ever compare to the sheer power of my rationalizations. My eyes are incapable of blinding me to my dreams. My ears will never hear an argument able to drown out the voice of ambition within my own head. For when I feel good, I am good.

The same endorphins that flood my brain when I hold an options victory are the same ones that I feel during my most delusional dreams of grandeur.

The same shades of green that color a blessed portfolio are just as vivid as the one’s I see in my day dreams.

No loss matters. No amount of money could ever make me change my mind. My belief is unbreakable, and it’s dividends of joy are always received.

So, if I believe I will become a billionaire, I might as well already be one.

If I believe I am the next Warren Buffet, then I already am.

My heart still flutters, my ego grows. The further I float above reality, the more impossible it becomes to drag that euphoria back to the ground.

And that, *my friend*, is all that matters to me.",11,bearish,2025-04-20 11:58:15
