But importers say that a glitch in the system has meant that they have not started paying tariffs yet, despite Turnip saying that the tariffs, particularly the 145% tariffs on China, are already in place.

According to CNBC, the glitch comes from CBP currently not being able to tell which ships are exempted from the tariffs, because they were “on the water” before the tariffs went into effect, and those that were shipped out after the tariffs.""

* come up with a fairly good initial plan balancing my heavy investment into puts with calls to recover my initial buy in that should have made money
* holding onto options that have gained significant value for too long, fuck 4-6x returns this is going to be the mega dump and I want in! Only to watch things quickly flip and the gains fade away
* not buying multiple contracts so I can cash out most for nice gains but still have a little action in play
* not cutting my losses quickly enough and forgetting how quickly the theta gang is coming for my unlubed asshole
* panic selling options that still had lots of time to gain value from a volatile market
* forgetting day trading limits and getting stuck in dumb positions because I’m a poor degenerate that doesn’t have 25k to swing around

Every option I had going into this week would have made money if I had just been happy with 4-6x gains and I managed to to loose 87% of my money
